            <h3>Cajamarca, Peru</h3>
            <div class="flex">
                <img id="flag" src="images/peru-flag.jpeg" alt="Peru Flag">
                <p>Cajamarca is a city located in the north of Peru, the city is known for being rich in mining and
                    dairy products.
                    Although Cajamarca does attract many tourists, the most popular time of the year to visit is
                    February because Carnival takes place throughout this month. Carnival sparks many celebrations,
                    parades, festivals, parties, and, most importantly, water and shaving cream fights. Peruvians and
                    tourists alike hunt each other down with water balloons and aerosol cans filled with shaving cream,
                    which creates a fun and exciting adventure every day during the month of February!</p>
